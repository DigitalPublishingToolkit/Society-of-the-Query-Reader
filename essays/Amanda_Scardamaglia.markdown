    In 2012 the Language Council of Sweden added the word ‘ungoogleable’ to
    its annual list of Swedish words that are not in the Swedish dictionary
    but have become part of the common vernacular. The word, which in
    Swedish translates to ‘ogooglebar’, was defined as something that cannot
    be found on any search engine. Google objected and demanded the
    definition be amended to refer specifically to its search engine,
    incorporating a disclaimer stating that Google is a trademark of Google
    Inc. The Swedish Language Council resisted, and, after observing that
    language development and the protection of trademarks are anomalous, it
    declared the word would not be included on its final list.

In 2012 the Language Council of Sweden added the word ‘ungoogleable’ to
its annual list of Swedish words that are not in the Swedish dictionary
but have become part of the common vernacular. The word, which in
Swedish translates to ‘ogooglebar’, was defined as something that cannot
be found on any search engine. Google objected and demanded the
definition be amended to refer specifically to its search engine,
incorporating a disclaimer stating that Google is a trademark of Google
Inc. The Swedish Language Council resisted, and, after observing that
language development and the protection of trademarks are anomalous, it
declared the word would not be included on its final
list.[^1]

The irony of Google taking issue with the use of its trademark in this
way is surely not lost on those familiar with the spate of lawsuits
around the world brought against the search engine in recent times for
its perceived lack of respect for trademarks and trademark law. It is
certainly not lost on the trademark owners who have instituted these
proceedings, although their condescension is not exclusively reserved
for Google of course, with trademark owners equally concerned about any
use of their trademarks by internet intermediaries and their
advertisers.

So how did we get here?

The proliferation of information available on the internet and the
growth of internet-related businesses has resulted in an exponential
rise in the power of the search engine – as both repositories of
information and advertising platforms with enormous reach. This shift in
the business landscape has led to a swell in litigious claims and a
growing jurisprudence on search engine liability, much of which relates
to questions of trademark infringement arising from the use of third
party trademarks as keywords in the online advertising services offered
by web search engines.

The following discussion will explore the judicial response to such
claims in Europe, the United States, and Australia, but with a
particular focus on Google, since allegations of search engine liability
concerning trademark infringement have almost exclusively been leveled
against Google, as the market leader.[^2] It will also
consider the application of consumer protection legislation as an
alternative means of regulating the use of third party trademarks as
keywords in online search and advertising. The purpose of this study is
to test whether search engine liability, in the jurisdictions subject to
review, is a reality, a possibility, or largely illusory. In order to
undertake this analysis, it is necessary to first touch on the operation
of internet search engines and their advertising services, including the
use of keyword advertising.

###Understanding Keyword Advertising

Keyword advertising enables search providers and their advertisers to
deliver relevant, tailored, consumer-specific ads to internet users. It
also allows search engine operators to generate substantial revenue from
the sale of keyword advertising. For example, in 2012 the global
internet advertising market was worth U.S. $100.2 billion, representing
a year-on-year growth of 17 percent, and a 20 percent share of the total
global advertising market.[^3] Given its profitability,
some search engines operate on a pay for placement basis only, where
search results are primarily based on paid placements and not relevance.[^4]
The distinction between relevance-based search
results, or natural search results, and sponsored ads is best explained
in the present context, by reference to the Google search engine.[^5]

When a user enters a term in the Google search engine, users are given
two main search results: natural (or organic) search results and
sponsored links. Organic search results provide links to web pages that
are ranked in order of relevance to the search terms entered, as
determined by a complex algorithm developed by Google. Although the
precise nature and workings of the algorithm remain unknown, its use
means that organic search result rankings cannot be purchased.

Sponsored links on the other hand, are a form of advertising, created by
advertisers who pay the relevant search provider each time a user clicks
on it. With respect to the Google search engine, sponsored links are
displayed separately from organic search results and can appear in a box
marked ‘Ad’ or ‘Ad/s related to…’ usually above the organic search
results. Significantly, the order and ranking of sponsored links and
whether they will appear at all in response to a user query is
determined by Google’s AdWords program and not the Google web search
algorithm.

The AdWords program allows advertisers to create, change, and monitor
the performance of sponsored links. These sponsored links consist of
three parts. The first part is the headline, which incorporates a link
to a webpage. The second part is the address of the webpage. The third
part of the link is the advertising text, which usually consists of a
brief summary of the subject of the sponsored link and sometimes the
advertiser’s business.

A third and more recent addition to Google’s search results page is the
Knowledge Graph box. According to Google, ‘[t]he Knowledge Graph enables
you to search for things, people or places that Google knows about –
landmarks, celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, geographical
features, movies, celestial objects, works of art and more – and
instantly get information that’s relevant to your query.’[^6]
The relevant information Google refers to appears
on the right hand side of the search results page, linking to public
sources including Wikipedia. The information shown in this section is
derived from a collection of information about real-world things and
their connections to other things, where Knowledge Graph gathers
information about a topic from several sources, before refining the
information based on the most popular questions people ask about that
subject.

For an example of Google’s search layout see Figure 1 which shows the
results page generated in Australia in response to a desktop search
query using the LACOSTE trademark as a keyword, including both organic
search results and sponsored links, as well as Google Knowledge Graph.

![Fig. 1. Google Search Engine Response to Keyword Search for LACOSTE](images/Amanda_Scardamaglia/Figure-1.png "Fig. 1: Google Search Engine Response to Keyword Search for LACOSTE")

Returning to sponsored links, advertisers using AdWords are able to
specify each part of the three-part sponsored link. The advertiser can
also specify keywords that will trigger the appearance of the sponsored
link when that keyword is entered as a search term in the Google search
engine. Furthermore, advertisers are able to take advantage of keyword
insertion, a special feature of AdWords, where the search phrase entered
by a user is then used as the clickable headline for the sponsored link.

There was a period when Google did not allow advertisers to link their
ads to the trademarks of others, but in 2004 its advertising policy was
amended in the United States and Canada to allow advertisers to purchase
their competitors’ trademarks as keywords.[^7] This
policy was subsequently applied to the United Kingdom and Ireland in
2008 and the rest of Europe in 2010.[^8] In early 2013
the policy was rolled out further in countries including China, Hong
Kong, and Australia, with Google announcing it ‘…will no longer prevent
advertisers from selecting a third party’s trademark as a keyword in ads
targeting these regions’.[^9]

As to its competitors, Microsoft’s Yahoo! and Bing search engines also
provide keyword advertising services, as does Baidu. With respect to
Microsoft, initially its keyword policy differed somewhat from Google's,
but in 2011, the company announced it was amending its Intellectual
Property Policy so as to no longer review complaints in relation to the
use of trademarks as keywords in the United States and Canada, in order
to align its practices with the current industry standard, namely
Google.[^10] Microsoft will however, still
investigate a complaint about trademark use in the text of a search ad,[^11]
as will Google, if it is inconsistent with its
AdWords Trademark Policy.[^12] Furthermore, in
Australia, Brazil, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand,
Ireland, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, Microsoft will investigate a
complaint about trademark infringement with respect to keyword use.[^13]

These changes in search engine policy and the consequential practice of
advertisers purchasing competitors’ trademarks as keywords have created
a number of challenges for judges in having to adapt and apply laws and
legal doctrines to technologies and trademark uses unimagined at the
time of enactment.[^14] As previously noted, most of
the litigation in this space concerns the potential liability of Google
for trademark infringement flowing from its sale of trademarks as
keywords to third parties, although some trademark owners have also
pursued the advertisers directly.

###Trademarks as Keywords and Trademark Infringement

In most jurisdictions, trademark infringement is premised on the
assessment of consumer confusion, which flows from the alleged
infringing use of a mark where that use is consistent with the function
of a trademark in the course of trade. For example, in the United
States, trademark infringement is defined as ‘[…] any reproduction,
counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in
connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or
advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such
use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive
[…]’.[^15] In order to succeed in a claim for
infringement therefore, one must show (1) that the defendant has used
(2) an identical or similar mark (3) in commerce (4) and that the
defendant’s use is likely to confuse consumers.[^16]

Confusion is also a central tenant in the conceptualization of trademark
infringement under Article 5(1)(a) of the First Council Directive to
Approximate the Laws of the Member States Relating to Trade
Marks.[^17] According to case law, a claim for
infringement under Article 5(1)(a) can only succeed if the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) there must be use of a sign by a third
party within the relevant territory; (2) the use must be in the course
of trade; (3) it must be without the consent of the proprietor of the
trademark owner; (4) it must be of a sign that is identical to the
trademark; (5) it must be in relation to goods or services which are
identical to those for which the trademark is registered; (6) and it
must affect or be liable to affect the functions of the
trademark.[^18]

In Australia, the grounds for relief under the Trade Marks Act
1995**(Australia) are somewhat similar. Here, infringement occurs when a
person uses as a trademark a sign that is substantially identical to or
deceptively similar to a registered trademark in relation to the same
class of goods (or services) for which the trademark is
registered.[^19] As in the United States and Europe,
there is a threshold requirement that the alleged infringer must use the
registered trademark as a trademark, so as to distinguish the goods and
services to which it is attached. Further, trademark infringement is
based on the use of a mark that is either substantially identical to or
deceptively similar to a registered trademark, so as to confuse or
deceive consumers.[^20]

When it comes to the use of trademarks as keywords, cases of
infringement usually hinge on whether the use of a trademarked term in
search results constitutes use as a trademark, consistent with the legal
definition of use. Another precarious issue pertains to consumer
confusion. Both of these issues have come to surface in the suite of
infringement lawsuits brought against Google over the last decade, where
trademark use and confusion have been pivotal in determining whether the
search engine could or should be liable for direct or contributory
trademark infringement.

Now while some of the first reported cases involving internet
intermediaries looked to have broadened the class of people who could
face legal liability for trademark infringement,[^21]
in the subsequent cases involving Google, the potential for liability
has seemingly contracted, as most of the lawsuits instituted against the
search engine have been largely resolved in its favor. Perhaps the most
publicized trademark infringement action involving Google is the famed
European Court of Justice (ECJ) case of Google France SARL v Louis
Vuitton Malletier SA.[^22]

Culminating over several years and bringing together three separate
lawsuits, this case was considered a victory for Google and search
engine operators in general. Here, Louis Vuitton brought proceedings
against Google France, alleging it had allowed advertisers to purchase
Louis Vuitton trademarks as keywords via Google’s AdWords program and
link to websites selling imitation Louis Vuitton goods and to competing
websites, in breach of Article 5 of the First Council Directive. The
claim ultimately failed, with the ECJ deciding that search engine
operators do not infringe trademarks by selling keywords that correspond
to third party trademarks. This is because although search engines are
carrying out commercial activity in the course of trade, these
activities do not constitute use, as required for the purposes of
trademark infringement:

>The fact of creating the technical conditions necessary for the use of a
sign and being paid for that service does not mean that the party
offering the service itself uses the sign. To the extent to which it has
permitted its client to make such a use of the sign, its role must, as
necessary, be examined from the angle of rules of law other than Article
5 […].[^23]

After determining that the use requirement could not be established, the
ECJ terminated its inquiry at the first step of the above mentioned
framework for infringement, without examining some of the other more
pertinent questions relating to infringement, such as whether AdWords
undermines the function of the trademark, including the economic
function, which is central to the rationalization of trademark
law.[^24] Nevertheless, this decision has become a
reference point for the milieu of claims brought against Google around
the world, where the company has similarly escaped liability.

This success has prompted some commentators to assert that Google has
won the trademark and keyword advertising battle,[^25]
paving the way for the company and its competitors to continue selling
trademarks as keywords, unfettered and without legal consequence. There
is some truth to this claim, although a closer examination of the legal
basis for such decisions and the circumstances surrounding the search
engine’s success would suggest that such an assertion is somewhat of an
exaggeration. There are several reasons for this.

First, a number of lawsuits brought against Google have been dismissed
before the issues could be tested in court. For example, Soaring Helmet,
manufacturers of the VEGA motorcycle helmet, voluntarily dismissed
Google from its trademark lawsuit against Bill Me Inc and
others.[^26] More recently, Google was successful in
defending a claim of trademark infringement, among a laundry list of
other claims.[^27] As far as the trademark
infringement claim was concerned, the matter was dismissed after the
Court held the plaintiff’s trademark, Home Decor Center, was too generic
to warrant protection.

Furthermore one cannot say definitively that Google has been victorious
against aggrieved trademark owners, given that several lawsuits have
been settled out of court, including the long-running dispute between
Google and software company Rosetta Stone.[^28] Indeed
it is worth noting that while Google was successful in the first
instance;[^29] on appeal the Fourth Circuit reversed
the District Court on several key points, including claims of direct
trademark infringement, contributory infringement, and dilution, before
both parties settled on confidential terms.[^30]

As a result, several substantive issues related to trademark
infringement in the search engine context are yet to be considered by
the courts, let alone resolved. In Australia for example, the issue of
search engine liability for trademark infringement has not even come
before the courts, although perhaps this is because the likelihood of
success is seen as too remote, especially with respect to the
interpretation of the trademark use doctrine.[^31] And
even when the courts have been given an opportunity to make a clear
statement on the application of trademark law in the context of search
engines, against the most dominant search engine in the world no less,
they have not done so. The most obvious case in point is the Google
France decision, when the Court dismissed the claim for trademark
infringement on the basis that the use as a trademark requirement had
not been established. Critically however, the court did not make any
assessment as to the other elements of trademark infringement, including
likelihood of confusion, much to the dismay of some:

>[…] the ECJ left open the door for future misbehaviour. For example,
suppose that, as a bonus for its most loyal clients, Google modified its
natural search results so that on occasion the link to a trademark
proprietor’s website diverts users to an advertiser’s page. This
behaviour would surely cause significant confusion, yet it would be
difficult to attribute to the underlying advertiser, as opposed to
Google itself. Under the Court’s analysis, however, Google would still
be immune from trademark infringement liability.[^32]

Another point worth observing is that while the ECJ concluded that
Google’s conduct does not constitute use sufficient enough to found a
cause of action for trademark infringement, this is not entirely
consistent with some of the American case law on this issue, which in
itself is conflicting.[^33] As such, there is a real
possibility for future test cases to shed further light or clarification
on the concept of trademark use, consumer confusion, and, particularly,
whether keyword use is likely to affect the function of the trademark.
The latter issues are especially crucial, since there is conflicting
evidence as to whether consumers are actually confused or understand the
nature and operation of sponsored links.[^34] Another
area that has not been sufficiently flushed out is the case of
contributory trademark liability, as opposed to primary liability, an
issue that was in dispute in the aforementioned Rosetta Stone case but
was settled out of court.

Whether such test cases will materialize in the near future is unclear
but is probably unlikely, with trademark owners seemingly resigned to
the fact that as Google has continued to successfully stave off
trademark infringement lawsuits, the legality of its AdWords program is
becoming more entrenched and legitimated. Consequently, trademark owners
have shifted their focus to the advertisers responsible for purchasing
third party trademarks as keywords, with better
success.[^35] The possibility of holding advertisers
as opposed to intermediaries liable was actually foreshadowed in Google
France, although the ECJ deferred a decision about the advertiser’s
liability to the referring Court.

We have seen the flow on effect of this in the recent Interflora Inc v
Marks and Spencer Plc decision. In this case Arnold J held that in
purchasing 'Interflora' (and similar variations) as keywords, Marks and
Spencer, was liable for trademark infringement because it did not enable
reasonably well-informed and reasonably attentive internet users, or
enabled them only with difficulty, to ascertain whether the service
referred to in the advertisements originated from the proprietor of the
trademarks or an undertaking economically connected with it, or else
originated from a third party.[^36] The Federal Court
of Australia also recently found an advertiser liable for trademark
infringement in similar circumstances.[^37]

Given these decisions, it would not be surprising to see trademark
owners pursue the advertisers responsible for the purchase of keywords
exclusively, rather than the search engines responsible for facilitating
that purchase.[^38] This does not mean however, that
search engines such as Google have or will escape all liability for
their role in the sale of trademarks as keywords. To say that would be
to ignore the potential scope and application of laws that govern
against misleading and deceptive conduct in advertising – laws which in
all likelihood, are better suited to regulating new and emerging market
activities such as keyword advertising than trademark law is or ever
could be.

###Misleading and Deceptive Conduct and False Advertising

Some litigants have sought to test the legitimacy of Google’s AdWords
facility under the laws regulating misleading and deceptive conduct and
false advertising, as an alternative to the often argued claim of
trademark infringement. One of the most notable examples came to a head
in Australia, when the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
(ACCC) instituted proceedings against Google and the Trading Post for
breaching section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), now section
18 of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL),[^39] which
prohibits traders from engaging in conduct that is misleading and
deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. \

This section and its predecessor have been interpreted broadly, so that
they can serve their function as ‘[…] a norm of commercial conduct which
applies in dealings with the public at large, with individuals and
between traders’.[^40] As such, section 18 has been
applied to sanction the use of misleading brand names, get-up, or
packaging of products,[^41] misleading business and
company names,[^42] as well as domain
names.[^43] It also prohibits misleading statements
and representations made in advertising including online advertising,
and in this way, is analogous to the false advertising prohibitions
found in other jurisdictions.[^44]

The ACCC’s case against Google related to its broader claim relating to
various sponsored links.[^45] The essence of this
broad claim was that each of the disputed sponsored links were
misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, because they
included a headline that linked to the advertisers’ webpage rather than
to a webpage of the advertisers’ competitor whose trading or product
name featured in the headline. For example, the first named respondent,
the Trading Post, a classified advertising business, was alleged to have
purchased 'Just 4x4s Magazine' among others as keywords (with Just 4x4s
Magazine being a competitor of the Trading Post in providing classified
advertising for four wheel drives). Thus, when a user entered the search
terms 'Just 4x4s Magazine' into the Google search engine, they would be
returned the following search result:

![Fig. 2. Google Search Engine Response to Keyword Search for JUST 4X4S MAGAZINE](images/Amanda_Scardamaglia/Figure-2.png "Fig. 2: Google Search Engine Response to Keyword Search for JUST 4X4S MAGAZINE")

The dispute, so far as it relates to Google, centered on its publishing
the misleading and deceptive sponsored links, including the
advertisement mentioned above. Specifically, the ACCC alleged that by
publishing or displaying the sponsored links in question, Google was
liable for misleading and deceptive conduct, as the *maker* of those
advertisements. The ACCC further claimed that Google had engaged in
misleading and deceptive conduct by failing to distinguish sufficiently
between its organic search results and its sponsored links.

Although the proceedings against the Trading Post were settled, the case
against Google was subject to protracted litigation. The matter was
heard at first instance before Justice Nicholas in the Federal Court. He
found that although four out of the 11 sponsored links subject to
dispute were misleading and deceptive such that the advertisers were
liable, Google had not made those
representations.[^46] Rather they had merely
communicated those representations as the publisher – and as the
publisher, Google was not liable. As to the claim that Google had failed
to sufficiently distinguish between its organic search results and its
sponsored links, the primary judge found that ordinary and reasonable
members of the public who have access to a computer connected to the
internet would have understood sponsored links were advertisements that
were different from Google’s organic search results such that Google was
not liable.

The ACCC appealed, challenging the finding that Google had not made any
false and misleading representations. The finding that Google had not
differentiated between its organic search results and sponsored links
was not subject to appeal. Here, the Full Court unanimously reversed the
decision of the primary judge, finding that Google had engaged in
misleading and deceptive conduct. Keane CJ, Jacobson and Lander JJ
distinguished Google’s role as publisher from publishers of traditional
advertising, including newspapers and television stations, finding that
it had acted as more than a mere conduit and was the maker of the
advertisements:

>The circumstance that the sponsored link is displayed as Google’s
response to a user’s insertion of a search term into Google’s search
engine prevents any analogy between this case and the case of the
bill-board owner or the owner of a telephone network or the publisher of
a newspaper or a telecaster who simply displays an advertisement of
another. In those cases the medium is not concerned with the content of
the advertiser’s message: in the four instances in question here Google
created the message which it presents. Google’s search engine calls up
and displays the response to the user’s enquiry. It is Google’s
technology which creates that which is displayed. Google did not merely
repeat or pass on a statement by the advertiser: what is displayed in
response to the user’s search query is not the equivalent of Google
saying here is a statement by an advertiser which is passed on for what
it is worth.[^47]

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Google appealed, and the matter went before the
High Court of Australia, where in a much publicized and anticipated
decision, [^48] the bench unanimously allowed the
appeal. Significant to this finding was the fact that the evidence
against Google ‘[…] never rose so high as to prove that Google
personnel, as distinct from the advertisers, had chosen the relevant
keywords, or otherwise created, endorsed, or adopted the sponsored
links’.[^49] As such, Google was not liable as the
maker of misleading and deceptive advertising content.

Some consider the High Court’s decision a lost opportunity, since the
statutory language of section 18 of the ACL and its precursor are ‘[…]
sufficiently open-ended to catch the situation at hand’.
[^50] Even so, one should not dismiss the
possibility of search engine liability on this front entirely, since the
High Court did not consider a number of complex issues that are critical
to the application of consumer protection laws to online service
providers, including Google.

For example, while the High Court found that Google was not the maker of
the misleading and deceptive advertising content, it did not assess
whether Google had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by
aiding, abetting, counseling, or procuring misleading conduct, on the
part of the advertisers. Obviously this was beyond the scope of the
claim alleged by the ACCC, and so it was not necessary for members of
the Court to make any determination on this issue. Even so, it may still
be open for persons aggrieved by Google’s conduct, including consumers
and trademark owners, to take legal action against Google on this
ground.

It is further possible that Google may yet be found liable for the
publication of misleading organic search results in breach of section 18
of the ACL, especially since although the ACCC alleged there was a class
of consumers who did not understand the distinction between organic
search results and sponsored links, they did not produce any survey
evidence to support this proposition.[^51] Thus, the
production of such consumer evidence in the future may prove to be
significant. This issue might be enlivened sooner rather than later if
Google moves towards the introduction of banner ads as
speculated,[^52] while the addition of Google’s
Knowledge Graph adds another layer to the vexed issue of confusion.

Another issue that was not adequately clarified was the application of
the publisher’s defense, which provides immunity to publishers when they
publish advertisements that are false or misleading but has no reason to
suspect they would be in breach of the law. [^53]
Because Google was not found to have engaged in misleading and deceptive
conduct, the High Court did not think it necessary to consider the
relevance of this defense. The majority of French CJ, Crennan, and
Kiefel JJ did however observe that:

>[…] an intermediary publisher who has endorsed or adopted a published
representation of an advertiser without appreciating the capacity of
that representation to mislead or deceive may have resort to the
statutory defence. In those circumstances, recognising that its business
carried a risk of unwitting contravention, an intermediary publisher may
need to show that it had some appropriate system in place to succeed in
the defence that it did not know and had no reason to suspect that the
publication of that representation would amount to a
contravention.[^54]

Whether Google’s policies and practices would have been considered an
appropriate system by which it could rely on the publisher’s defense was
not discussed. Given this, there may still be some life to this limb of
liability, in terms of regulating the conduct of internet search engines
and, even more broadly, their advertisers in the future. Indeed, in the
current landscape, such provisions seem the most likely legal avenue to
fill this regulatory hole.

There are a number of reasons why this might be true. First, this
alternative may prove more palatable for the courts, since it does not
require them to apply trademark doctrine in a way which might depart
from traditional principles of trademark law in order to guard against
confusion.[^55] Second, consumer protection
legislation, particularly in Australia, is also flexible enough for the
courts to interpret broadly, so as to accommodate new and emerging
commercial practices such as internet advertising.

###Where to From Here?

Claims of search engine liability require carefully balancing a number
of interests – the interests of trademark owners, consumers, and
competition more generally. In exercising this juggling act, the courts
have recognized that internet advertising is simply a modern form of
comparative advertising that is ultimately good for consumers and good
for competition because it promotes choice, placing priority on these
interests above all else. This much was acknowledged by Arnold’s J in
the aforementioned Interflora**decision, where it was observed that ‘[…]
keyword advertising is not inherently or inevitably objectionable from a
trade mark perspective. On the contrary, the case law […] in this field
recognises that, as a general rule, keyword advertising promotes
competition […]'.[^56]

As such, the courts have resisted applying a cheapest cost
avoider[^57] interpretation to questions of search
engine liability and have instead recognized Google’s advertising
service as a legitimate undertaking. Perhaps this is because the
alternative would ‘[…] jeopardize the internet’s potential as an
information resource and a catalyst for competition
[…]’.[^58] It may also have an undesirable chilling
effect in restricting the dissemination of truthful comparative
advertising and unnecessarily sanctioning legitimate behavior by
internet intermediaries.[^59] Thus, as Eric Goldman
puts it:

To increase the odds of efficient and successful searches, searchers
should be able to pick the search terms they want and search providers
should be able to use those search terms to deliver the most helpful
content to searchers. Thus trademark law must step aside when searchers
receive content they may want.[^60]

As the preceding discussion has demonstrated, the case law in this area
indicates that the courts have for the most part accepted this
proposition, and have been prepared to quarantine the use of trademarks
and keywords from the realms of trademark infringement by search engine
operators, although the advertisers have not been afforded the same
protection. Thus, while there is still some scope to test the ambit of
such claims further, it appears that search engine liability, at least
for the moment and at least from the perspective of trademark law, is an
unlikely proposition. Any potential liability for trademark infringement
therefore would more likely rest against the advertisers. And as to the
laws relating to misleading and deceptive conduct or false advertising –
well, in the absence of any statutory intervention, they seem the most
viable and appropriate mechanism to regulate the conduct of both search
engines and advertisers in this context in the future.

    26 March 2013, http://www.sprakradet.se/15922 (in Swedish).

[^2]: As the market leader, Google generates more than U.S. \$50 billion
    in revenue annually, the majority of which is generated from its
    advertising. See Google Inc, ‘Form 10-K: Annual Report’, 29 January
    2013,
    http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1404/119312513028362/filing-main.htm.
    According to NetMarketShare, as of January 2014, Google’s global
    desktop search engine market share was 71.36 percent. Its closest
    competitors were Baidu (16.35 percent) and Bing (5.83 percent). In
    the past, this figure was above 90 percent, but has been pegged back
    significantly by the growth of the Chinese language search engine
    Baidu. See NetMarketShare, ‘Desktop Search Engine Market Share’,
    January2014,
    http://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?qprid=4&qpcustomd=0.

[^3]: In 2017 this figure is expected to grow to U.S. \$185 billion. See

    .

[^4]: See for example GoTo.com v Walt Disney Co, 202 F 3d 1199 (9th Cir,

    produced search results using an algorithm weighted in favour of
    paid advertisers.

[^12]: Google Advertising Policies Help, ‘AdWords Trademark Policy’. That
    is, where a third party trademark is being used and the exceptions
    do not apply. Thus, advertisers can use a trademarked term in an ad
    if they are authorized to do so, or if they are using the term
    descriptively. Furthermore, advertisers can use a trademark in ad
    text if the advertiser complies with Google’s policy on resellers
    and informational sites, which can be found at

    there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.

[^18]: As set out by Arnold J in Interflora Inc v Marks and Spencer Plc
    [2013] EWHC 1291 at [177].

[^19]: Trade Marks Act 1995 (Australia) s 120(1). Trademark infringement
    can also occur where a sign is being used in relation to goods which
    are the same description as the goods (or services) for which the

    (or goods). See section 120(2) of the *Trade Marks Act 1995*

    available from
    http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/18/ijlit.eat010.full.pdf.
    The lack of case law in Australia may also be attributed to the fact
    that unlike other jurisdictions, the Trade Marks Act 1995
    (Australia) does not make any provision for contributory or indirect
    liability.

[^32]: ‘Trademark Law – Infringement Liability: European Court of Justice
    Holds that Search Engines do not Infringe Trademarks’, *Harvard Law
    Review*124 (2010): 648, 654-655.

[^33]: See for example Rescuecom Corp v Google Inc, 562 F 3d 123 (2d Cir,
    2009) and compare with the earlier case of 1-800 Contacts Inc v
    WhenU.com Inc, 414 F 3d 400 (2d Cir, 2005).

[^34]: For example in Rosetta Stone Ltd v Google Inc, 2012 WL 1155143 (4th
    Cir, 2012), the District Court cited an internal Google study
    finding that even sophisticated consumers were sometimes unaware
    that sponsored links were advertisements. Compare this to the
    findings set out in David J. Franklyn and David A. Hyman, ‘Trademarks
    as Search Engine Keywords: Much Ado About Something?’, *Harvard
    Journal of Law and Technology*26.2 (2013): 1-65.

[^35]: Although see 1-800 Contacts Inc v Lens.com Inc , No 11-4114,
    11-4204, 11-4022 (10th Cir, 2013) and Allied Interstate LLC v Kimmel
    & Silverman PC, WL 4245987 (SDNY, 2013) as examples of trademark
    infringement lawsuits instituted by trademark proprietors against
    advertisers who have used third party trademarks as keywords, but
    which were unsuccessful, for want of sufficient evidence of
    confusion.

[^36]: Interflora Inc v Marks and Spencer Plc [2013] EWHC 1291 at [318].

[^37]: REA Group Ltd v Real Estate 1 Ltd [2013] FCA 559.

[^38]: They should do so with caution however as the Interflora decision
    may be confined to its facts, where confusion only arose given the
    unique nature of the Interflora business. Accordingly, it is
    possible the case will not serve as a precedent such that all
    advertisers will be liable for trademark infringement in the future.
    Rather, in most instances, such as the aforementioned 1-800 Contacts
    and Allied Interstate decisions, evidence of confusion will not be
    usually sufficient.

    in its organic search results. It is entirely plausible that such a
