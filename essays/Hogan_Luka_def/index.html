	<p class="block">M.E. Luka: What is Google Suggest?</p>
	<p class="block">Mél Hogan: Though refined over the years, Google Suggest has been an experimental feature since 2004. Currently, not every user is privy to the same suggestions by Google; it’s therefore needed to address the intentions of the algorithm and its discrimination based on location, language, as well as a series of other factors. According to Google’s blog, terms pertaining to nationality (but not religion) are removed from suggestions, as are hate- or violence-related queries, personally identifiable information, porn and adult content, legally mandated removals, and piracy-related items. But reading through this archive, it’s incredibly violent, so it would be great to see how Google defines violence and how it polices it.</p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">Everyday words become defined through user queries, feeding into a weird, increasingly funneled and frenzied, though not entirely random, pool of associations between stereotypes, lyrics, memes, as well as sincere searches. </p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">As you type in Google’s search bar, its algorithm predicts and displays search queries based on users’ search activities, including the contents of web pages indexed by Google (known as Google Suggest or Autocomplete). While this drop-down list of calculated suggestions completing user queries has spawned several memes, inspired game-like interaction, and invited scrutiny over the so-called collective archive it generates, I want our conversation to go in an exploratory direction and expose some of Google’s suggestions over the course of the last four years. </p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">ML: OK, then let’s start with the words. You really picked 133 words? Why 133? What are they? Are they thematic?</p>
	<p class="block">MH: By way of free association and without counting how many words were going to be part of this archive, the 133 words I selected to track in Google Search over the course of the past four years are: academia, activism, arab, arabic, body, boy, boyfriend, bush, canada, capitalism, care, catholic, chance, change, christianity, communication, control, courage, cowboy, culture, daughter, death, destiny, dude, enemy, evil, faith, fascism, father, fear, female, femininity, feminism, fool, free speech, friendship, gay, gender, girl, girlfriend, god, goddess, goodness, gospel, government, grace, greed, gun, happiness, hate speech, heterosexuality, homophobia, homosexuality, hope, identity, insanity, instinct, integrity, is, islam, jew, jewish, joy, justice, labour, law, laziness, life, love, luck, lust, male, man, masculinity, mind, money, morality, mother, muslim, need, obsession, passion, peace, perception, perfection, phd, poverty, power, pride, procrastination, property, prostitution, quebec, race, racism, rage, reality, reason, religion, respect, right, sadness, sanity, satan, sex work, sex, sexiness, sexism, sexuality, shyness, sin, slavery, socialism, son, soul, spirit, terror, terrorism, thought, tom cruise, transgender, trouble, trust, want, war, woman, work, and xy. </p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">The entire archive is available at http://melhogan.com. </p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">For the first year, the process included selecting the words. Inspired by my trajectory in cultural studies/media studies, and my growing interests in the link between human emotion and algorithms, these words were the words I chose for this collection. At the time I had a few of these collections going, but this particular thread is the one I kept collecting over the past four years. </p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">ML: Why these words, in particular?</p>
	<p class="block">MH: I think the words and the searches they sugg<span class="text2">est point to things people are searching out in private. Real questions. Real worries. It might show how fucked up we all are. What do you think? Look below at ‘daughter is’ – while the suggestions change a little over time, the sentiment remains the same. I find that it’s the words that deno</span>te a relationship – daughter or boyfriend, for example <span class="text2">–</span> are the most deranged. People searching out answers about (and maybe on behalf of) others? Can Google suggestions become a way to suss out what others are experiencing? Is it where we go to feel normal, even if that normal is twisted?</p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">ML: Hmm. I don’t know. There’s something about the creepily fast predictive suggestions that kind of freaks me out. But maybe, yes, it could be a way to combine with others, emotionally, about shared topics. To have a conversation without having to engage in actual, live dialogue. I found the lists really compelling. And I found myself comparing the lists from one year to the next, because you gave them to me in a way that was easy to compare. </p>

	<p class="block">What’s more, when I see each of the columns of phrases typed up formally in a table (rather than just as screen grabs), they seem to gain authority, and I find myself fighting emotionally with the meanings thrown at me by the lists. Does every word cause this to happen? </p>
	<p class="block">MH: Not every word produces a result, so in that way this social experiment is biased to words that generate results, popular enough searches. What I've noticed is that these are the kinds of words that tend to provoke and trigger strange <span class="text2">–</span> and very sad <span class="text2">–</span> results from the pooled mindset that has become Google Search. I think, in part, that’s because there are genuine queries mixed in with vile equations that together form a sad but somewhat accurate definition of these words, as conceived of generally. Most of it is disgustingly violent. Some of it is more ambivalent. Some of it is just funny. I guess that’s a mirror of us…?</p>

We’re going to look back on all this one day and see how messed up we are, at this particular juncture, where what’s possible technologically is far ahead of any culturally agreed upon norms.

	<p class="block">MH: I haven’t read Young’s work but I do believe there’s a correlation. I think that the NSA debacles since the summer have more than proven that everything is tracked and stored, even if there’s always the problem of information overload, including making sense of huge pools of data. The ways in which it is different from biofeedback apps is that it’s much more collective and in some ways, more anonymous on the surface. Fitness apps really focus on your body, improvements, and motivation. Facebook is also profile focused and serves to link data to specific individuals within a network.

	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">But I think this is what Geert Lovink’s quote at the beginning of this conversation gets at: Google is not a public archive. But in a sense, if thought of as an archive <span class="text2">–</span> the possibilities for creative intervention are endless.</p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">ML: Ok, I’m all for this <span class="text2">–</span> generating endless creative possibilities. But let’s think it through on a theoretical level as well as through the research-creation you’ve undertaken. Does the theory match what you are finding in your collections? </p>
	<p class="block">MH: Google is now highly synonymous with the web, as the main search tool and for browsing the web (rivaled in its ubiquity only by the likes of social networking tools like Facebook and Twitter, which serve decidedly different primary functions than to provide rapid web-based searches). While highly technical, Google’s search function can be analyzed from a user/researcher perspective, contributing to an important dialogue about access, and more specifically about access to the web’s ‘past’. Google has been making its index available through cached copies – Google Cache – since 1998.</p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block2"><span class="text">To make its collection accessible, Google uses parallel processing ‘on a distributed network of thousands of low-cost computers’, which means it can crawl and harvest the web rapidly and in many ‘places’ simultaneously.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_48" class="text1"><a href="#note_48" title="48" class="calibre1">48</a></sup></sup><span class="text"> More simply, Google’s Googlebot ‘crawls’ around the web. From these crawls, the indexer sorts every word into a database, against which users’ queries are compared and for which search results are generated. Based on Google’s own Technological Overview, the vision and mission for the ‘perfect search’ is something that ‘understands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want’, according to Google co-founder Larry Page.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_49" class="text1"><a href="#note_49" title="49" class="calibre1">49</a></sup></sup></p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block2"><span class="text">However, this notion of the search is complicated by Siva Vaidhyanathan, who argues in his book, The Googlization of Everything that ‘search’ in Google is as much about what is concealed as what is revealed.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_50" class="text1"><a href="#note_50" title="50" class="calibre1">50</a></sup></sup><span class="text"> Google’s process is based on four elements: relevance, comprehensiveness, freshness, and speed. Combined, these are meant to allow searches to be at once comprehensive and subjective. These algorithms are updated weekly or even daily and are increasingly customized for each user, based on search history and location. Because algorithms are constantly changing, a search can hardly reproduce the same results (though this is difficult to verify and track because it rarely gets recorded). This, according to Vaidhyanathan, demonstrates that searches are not mathematical calculations based solely on correlations that objectively benefit users; they are largely the product of careful decisions by programmers working with and within large corporations. Vaidhyanathan also points out that the search privileges the recent over the classic, the local over the global, and the personal over the universal; all criteria that are largely about making consumption (online shopping) more effective, not research that relies on consistency in primary and secondary sources.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_51" class="text1"><a href="#note_51" title="51" class="calibre1">51</a></sup></sup></p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">ML: Aha. So Google searches are simultaneously about: shopping, random but funneled research, seeking specific kinds of solutions, and ... something else entirely.</p>
	<p class="block2"><span class="text">MH: Google aims to index all media and formats, and to do so continually, eventually moving into what they call ‘Realtime Search’. While the function itself ‘went missing’ in July 2011 when Google put forth its Google +1 platform, the concept itself remains intact.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_52" class="text1"><a href="#note_52" title="52" class="calibre1">52</a></sup></sup><span class="text"> Google’s Realtime Search (likely to re-emerge eventually) suggests that there is no difference between information created and information published – much like the Twitter application – where access is also said to be instantaneous.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_53" class="text1"><a href="#note_53" title="53" class="calibre1">53</a></sup></sup></p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block2"><span class="text">Interestingly, speed is the emphasis for </span><span class="text6">–</span><span class="text"> and increasing speed, the priority of </span><span class="text6">–</span><span class="text"> Google, whose query response time is ‘roughly one-fourth of a second’.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_54" class="text1"><a href="#note_54" title="54" class="calibre1">54</a></sup></sup><span class="text"> By relying on Realtime Search, Google’s archive shifts into the mode of a live or living archive, where events are not only documented moments after they occur in ‘real time’, but are also indexed and made available within seconds. The ‘distance’ between the past and the present is shortened, putting into question the proximity of primary and secondary sources within an online archival strategy. Furthermore, given Google’s super servers, a site can often be accessed more rapidly through the cached version than the ‘live’ page itself </span><span class="text6">–</span><span class="text"> and this is important as it effectively thwarts the notion of an original source and any idea of a singular ‘present’ moment or site as point of reference. </span></p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block2"><span class="text">As Google indexes content on the web to provide its search tool, it simultaneously makes copies of every document in the index (the Google index is roughly 100 million gigabytes).</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_55" class="text1"><a href="#note_55" title="55" class="calibre1">55</a></sup></sup><span class="text"> </span></p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block">ML: That is mind-blowing. But, not entirely ‘real’, right? You talk about the significant role played by caches and caching as a key element of data management.</p>
	<p class="block2"><span class="text">MH: In their on-site documentation, Google glosses over the fact that their index and archive is limited to files at 101 kilobytes of text; that is, the ‘cached version of the page will consist of the first 101 kbytes’, 120 kbytes for PDFs.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_56" class="text1"><a href="#note_56" title="56" class="calibre1">56</a></sup></sup><span class="text"> How and if this replicates the true size and complete document is not factored into the summary, an important lack in the overall framework that constitutes Google Cache’s collection of the past.</span></p>
	<p class="block"></p>
	<p class="block5"><span class="text3">In Google’s cache, a cached copy is a version of a web page as it appeared when it was indexed, which is not necessarily a reflection of the present or most current page. Website owners can opt out of the index, but their site is still likely to be cached despite the ‘cache’ button and access to the cached version being omitted from the interface (made invisible). As John Battelle dramatizes in The Search, Google creates ‘a world in which every click can be preserved forever’.</span><sup class="text5"><sup id="back_note_57" class="text1"><a href="#note_57" title="57" class="calibre1">57</a></sup></sup><span class="text3"> The default of multiplying remains even if the cached version is hidden or made inaccessible to the general public; files exist across servers, continually indexing the web’s data. However, since the cache exists as an opt-out process (rather than as an informed opt-in), most users overlook the issue of copies as they pertain to these mass automated indexing projects. Part of what makes Google Cache so valuable is its span, despite being largely understated in its current (re)presentation. Google restricts access to the index, making only the most recent indexed version available. Access is limited to one single revision. Needless to say, Google’s collection of the web’s past grows continuously, exponentially in size and, in turn, in value. However, because it is a corporation working in a competitive environment, Google’s indexing and its reliance on metadata standards are kept as trade secrets, which is a stark contrast to archives and library environments where this information is shared freely – and becomes more valuable for it.</span><sup class="text5"><sup id="back_note_58" class="text1"><a href="#note_58" title="58" class="calibre1">58</a></sup></sup><span class="text9"> </span><span class="text3">This brings attention to the ways the online realm is not accessible or ‘open’ simply by virtue of being online.</span></p>

	<p class="block2"><span class="text">ML: I think this is an important observation, and brings us back to a consideration of these patterns and limits as invariably sad (but not tragic) and ultimately violent (though sometimes life-affirming) in a disconcertingly Foucauldian way</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_59" class="text1"><a href="#note_59" title="59" class="calibre1">59</a></sup></sup><span class="text"> (the Panopticon?

	<p class="block2"><span class="text">MH: Unlike formal archives, Google Cache rejects the notion and impetus for creating a permanent historical record of the web. Instead, when pages disappear, Google claims to delete ‘dead’ links as quickly as possible.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_60" class="text1"><a href="#note_60" title="60" class="calibre1">60</a></sup></sup><span class="text"> For now, however, Google Cache remains more theoretical than practical, as, by Google’s own admission, there are only occasional clicks on the ‘cache’ button – and this for a search engine that gets in the order of a few billion hits each day.</span><sup class="text1"><sup id="back_note_61" class="text1"><a href="#note_61" title="61" class="calibre1">61</a></sup></sup></p>

To say it more plainly, preferably without slipping into the trite, thinking and feeling histories and experiences of love and life <span class="text2">–</span> through popular culture, the formation of culture, the sharing of culture <span class="text2">–</span> are transformative. Even (perhaps especially) through the widely shared Google Suggest experience. How reaffirming to see so many hundreds of thousands of others who have asked your question before you. And yet, your own questions <span class="text2">–</span> and answers/responses <span class="text2">–</span> may be entirely different. </p>
